@PACKAGE@
====================

This is a collection of configuration files including libvirt network
definitions, dnsmasq config files and iSCSI config files for libvirt
virtualization guest domains.


Prerequisites
-----------------------

 * virsh in libvirt
 * dnsmasq (must be installed if libvirt is installed)


Build
----------------

 [autoreconf -vfi]
 ./configure


Installation
---------------------

 make 
 make install


Create [S]RPM

Actions needed after post/pre installation, update and uninstallation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run "/usr/libexec/@PACKAGE@/net-install.py" to install the followings
 
  * /etc/libvirt/qemu/networks/net-{1,2,3}.xml


Also, you need to virsh net-start net-{1,2,3} to start networks actually.

[NOTE: If you installing @PACKAGE@ from RPM. The above operation is
automatically performed in post-install section so that you don't have to do
the above at all.]


Post uninstallation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The networks for virtualization environments (net-1, net-2 and net-3) are not
uninstalled automatically.  So, you need to uninstall by yourself if you want
to eliminate them entirely.

 1. Shutdown all of virtualization guests using these networks
 2. Shutdown and uninstall networks like the followings:

  * "for i in 1 2 3; do virsh destroy net-$i; done"
  * "for i in 1 2 3; do virsh undefine net-$i; done"


Pre/Post update

Pre: perform operations for post-uninstallation

Post: perform operations for post-installation
