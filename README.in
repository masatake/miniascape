@PACKAGE@
====================

WARNING: @PACKAGE@ is in pre-alpha state and will heavily udpate day by day, so
it may not work in your environment or might cause trouble. TRY IT IN YOUR OWN
RISK, PLEASE.



@PACKAGE@ is a collection of configurations and data to setup libvirt based
virtualization guests environment quickly.

Main objects are

 * Make network configuration for virtualization guests much easier.
   (pre-defined libvirt networks and DHCP configs)

 * Does not require expensive high-performance servers. 
   I try to make it installable on my vaio note pc
   (vaio type-P: Atom Z540, 64GB SSD, 2 G RAM)

 * Do not intend to replace other feature rich software such like
   RHEV, cobbler, etc.


Files
-----------------------

 * libvirt network definitions: /etc/@PACKAGE@/libvirt/*.xml
 * dnsmasq configs: /etc/@PACKAGE@/dnsmasq/*.conf
 * dnsmasq init scripts (per libvirt networks): /etc/rc.d/init.d/@PACKAGE@-$netname
 * misc tools: /usr/libexec/@PACKAGE@/*


Prerequisites
-----------------------

 * virsh in libvirt
 * dnsmasq (must be installed if libvirt is installed)


Build
----------------

 [autoreconf -vfi]
 ./configure


Installation
---------------------

 make 
 make install


Create [S]RPM
-----------------------

 make rpm | make srpm


Actions needed after post/pre installation, update and uninstallation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run "/usr/libexec/@PACKAGE@/net-install.py" to install the followings
 
  * /etc/libvirt/qemu/networks/net-{1,2,3}.xml


Also, you need to virsh net-start net-{1,2,3} to start networks actually.

[NOTE: If you installing @PACKAGE@ from RPM. The above operation is
automatically performed in post-install section so that you don't have to do
the above at all.]


Post uninstallation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The networks for virtualization environments (net-1, net-2 and net-3) are not
uninstalled automatically.  So, you need to uninstall by yourself if you want
to eliminate them entirely.

 1. Shutdown all of virtualization guests using these networks
 2. Shutdown and uninstall networks like the followings:

  * "for i in 1 2 3; do virsh destroy net-$i; done"
  * "for i in 1 2 3; do virsh undefine net-$i; done"


Pre/Post update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Pre: perform operations for post-uninstallation

Post: perform operations for post-installation
