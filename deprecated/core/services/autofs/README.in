About
=================================

The directory @ISODATADIR@ is arranged to keep ISO images for OS installation.

ISO images will be mounted under @ISOMNTDIR@ by autofs and the contents
of ISO images are provided as installation trees by web server program.


Please note that this package itself does not contain any ISO images and you
need to setup these by yourselves.


How to arrange ISO images
=====================================

1. put ISO images in the directory, @ISODATADIR@
2. ln -s that_iso_image_name the_name_follows_the_naming_convention
3. restorecon that_iso_image_name (if you enable SElinux)


Naming convention of symlinks of ISO images
--------------------------------------------

The name of ISO images or symlinks of them must be in the form like:

  DISTRO_NAME-MAJOR_VER-MINOR_VER-CLASS-ARCH-dvd.iso

and the part of the name except for '.iso' must be in /etc/auto.iso.

example:

  RHEL-4-u8-i386-AS.iso -> rhel-4-8-as-i386-dvd
