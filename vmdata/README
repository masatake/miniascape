About
==========

This is a collection of configuration files and tools to create virt. guests.



TODO
========

 * packaging tool for delta image ("vg-manage rpm" only supports single image
   packaging currently)
 * 'alternatives' support for various delta images
 * build time image path and relocatable image package:
   /var/lib/libvirt/images/ (current) ==> $builddir/.../
 * split guests' data and build tools
 * meta-packaging; generate rpm spec and files needed for autotools
 * convert primitive shell/makefile configuration files to YAML, JSON or
   whatever


Done/Resolved
--------------------

 * migrate kickstart data into virt-networks
 * invert the dependency of image packages:
   base depends on delta (current) ==> delta depends on base
 * eliminated EPEL dependency
