miniascape
====================

WARNING: miniascape is in pre-alpha state and will heavily udpate day by day, so
it may not work in your environment or might cause trouble. TRY IT IN YOUR OWN
RISK, PLEASE.



miniascape is a collection of configurations and data to setup libvirt based
virtualization guests build environment quickly.

Main objects are

 * Make network configuration for virtualization guests much easier.
   (pre-defined libvirt networks and DHCP configurations to allow access from
   host by hostnames)

 * Lightweight; Does not require expensive high-performance servers. I try to
   make it works on my non-high power vaio note pc having Intel Atom CPU and
   only 2G RAM.

 * Do not intend to become a replacement for other feature rich software such
   like RHEV, RHN Satellite and cobbler, etc.



Prerequisites
====================

Hardware and base OS
----------------------

* Intel x86 (i386 or x86_64) machine with VT extension (Intel VT or AMD-V) enabled
* RHEL 6 or Fedora 13+ or any linux distributions corresponding to these versions


tools
-------------------

 * make
 * virsh in libvirt
 * qemu-kvm
 * nginx or (apache) httpd
 * etc.



Build
====================

You have to build the followings at least.

* core
* datasrc/dvd


Each modules utilize autotools and can be built like:

 [autoreconf -vfi]
 ./configure


Installation
====================

I recommend to use RPMs but you can install them like:


 make 
 make install


Create [S]RPM
-----------------------

 make rpm | make srpm


Actions needed after post/pre installation, update and uninstallation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

See the README files in each package.


TODO
=====================

upstream works
-------------------

* -C | --config ffile option for virt-install
* enhancement for qemu-img to get base image path of delta image
* more D-Bus APIs for dnsmasq to simplify the control process of dnsmasq and make it dynamic


miniascape itself
-----------------------

See TODO section in core/README.
