miniascape
====================

WARNING: miniascape is in pre-alpha state and will heavily udpate day by day, so
it may not work in your environment or might cause trouble. TRY IT IN YOUR OWN
RISK, PLEASE.



miniascape is a collection of configurations and data to setup 'micro cloud' -
libvirt based virtualization guests environment quickly.

Main objects are

 * Make network configuration for virtualization guests much easier.
   (pre-defined libvirt networks and DHCP configs)

 * Lightweight; Does not require expensive high-performance servers. 
   I try to make it works on my non-high power vaio note pc
   (vaio type-P: Atom Z540, 64GB SSD, 2 G RAM)

 * Do not intend to become a replacement for other feature rich software such
   like RHEV, RHN Satellite and cobbler, etc.


Files
====================

 * libvirt network definitions: /etc/miniascape/libvirt/*.xml
 * dnsmasq configs: /etc/miniascape/dnsmasq/*.conf
 * dnsmasq init scripts per libvirt network: /etc/rc.d/init.d/dnsmasq-$netname
 * misc tools: /usr/libexec/miniascape/*


Prerequisites
====================

 * GNU make
 * virsh in libvirt
 * dnsmasq (must be installed if libvirt is installed)



RHEL 5
-----------------------

The followings are not included in RHEL. You have to get them from EPEL repository.

 * pyattr
 * python-cheetah
 * python-elementtree
 * python-nose
 * PyYAML



Build
====================

 [autoreconf -vfi]
 ./configure


Installation
====================

 make 
 make install


Create [S]RPM
-----------------------

 make rpm | make srpm


Actions needed after post/pre installation, update and uninstallation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run "/usr/libexec/miniascape/net-install.py" to install the followings
 
  * /etc/libvirt/qemu/networks/net-{1,2,3}.xml


Also, you need to virsh net-start net-{1,2,3} to start networks actually.

[NOTE: If you installing miniascape from RPM. The above operation is
automatically performed in post-install section so that you don't have to do
the above at all.]


Post uninstallation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The networks for virtualization environments (net-1, net-2 and net-3) are not
uninstalled automatically.  So, you need to uninstall by yourself if you want
to eliminate them entirely.

 1. Shutdown all of virtualization guests using these networks
 2. Shutdown and uninstall networks like the followings:

  * "for i in 1 2 3; do virsh destroy net-$i; done"
  * "for i in 1 2 3; do virsh undefine net-$i; done"


Pre/Post update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Pre: perform operations for post-uninstallation

Post: perform operations for post-installation


TODO
=====================

 * Make network definitions more configurable
 * Merge build (installation and packaging) scripts from vdbs: On going
 * Restructure and split tools and reference data
 * Wrote more test codes for scripts
 * Make http service daemon configurable
 * Merge ISC DHCP and bind backend as an option instead of dnsmasq
 * Converter: VMDK + VMX -> QCOW2 + libvirt domain XML

 * Eliminate GNU extensions in Makefile-s:

data/dnsmasq/Makefile.am:12: `%'-style pattern rules are a GNU make extension
data/libvirt/Makefile.am:6: `%'-style pattern rules are a GNU make extension

 * Handle rpmlint errors (see below)
