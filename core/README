====================
miniascape
====================

This package contains a collection of libvirt network and other core service
configurations, and build tools for packaged vms.


Prerequisites
============================

 * virsh in libvirt
 * qemu-img
 * virt-install in python-virtinst
 * nfs-utils [option]
 * scsi-target-utils (tgtd) [option]
 * etc.


Build
============================

 [autoreconf -vfi]
 ./configure


Installation
============================

 make 
 make install


Create [S]RPM
============================

 make srpm && mock *.rpm


What should be done after installation and updates
=========================================================

* post installation: run /usr/libexec/miniascape/net-install-all.sh
* post update: run /usr/libexec/miniascape/net-update-all.sh

And optionally, add host entries in /usr/share/libvirt/networks/hosts.add
into /etc/hosts if you want. (I recommend that.)


What should be done before uninstallation
=========================================================

* pre uninstallation: run uninstall.sh

or if you forgot to run /usr/libexec/miniascape/net-uninstall-all.sh before
uninstallation, do the followings after that.

::

    for net in net-1 net-2 net-3; do
        virsh net-destroy $net && virsh net-undefine $net
    done



TODO
=========================

* per guest configurations: vm.d/<VM Name>/{profile,autoinst,net,...}

* profile: hw profile came from profile data, e.g. profiles/rhel-5-5-guest-1.cfg
  * autoinst: kickstart/preseed config, e.g. autoinstall/rhel-5-cluster.ks.cfg
  * net: ip, mac and hostname [, cname, ...]

* network configuration update based on per guest configurations:

::

    hosts = []

    for f in glob.glob("vm.d/*/net"):
        hosts += (ip,mac,hostname) = open(f).read().split()

    ... (dump network xml with all host entries added) ...


* python-virtinst (upstream) fixes
  * image format error (someone's fix was merged in upstream but not yet released.) 
  * perms=rw storage option is not handled correctly: posted a patch


TODO (Done)
----------------------------------

* apache -> nginx transition
